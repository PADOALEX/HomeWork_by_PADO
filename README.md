##This C++ project simulates an electronic queue system, inspired by Cinevo, the leading laboratory network in Ukraine (part of the Swedish Medicover group). The system manages client registration using a ticket-based queue with priority handling â€” similar to real-world medical and diagnostic centers.

##Key features:

##Clients receive a unique ticket number.

##Each client has a priority level (Normal, Urgent, Emergency).

##Clients with higher priority are served before others.

##A full list of waiting clients is displayed in a user-friendly table.

##Supports adding multiple clients, calling next client, and real-time queue display.

##This system helps demonstrate concepts like structs, vectors, sorting, formatted output, and priority-based logic in C++.
